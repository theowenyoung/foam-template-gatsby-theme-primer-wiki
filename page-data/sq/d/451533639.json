You can go back with `ctrl+-`. Here, go to your [[inbox]]\n\n- [ ] to see how your notes are connected, execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command. See [[graph-visualization]].\n\n- [ ] #tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the `Tag Explorer` view on the left panel to find and navigate the tags in your knowledge base. See [[tags-and-tag-explorer]].\n\n- [ ] Foam supports [[spell-checking]].\n\n- [ ] You can also paste images in your Foam, just press `cmd+alt+v` to create the image file and link to it from your note. See [[paste-images-from-clipboard]].\n\n- [ ] You can use Foam for your daily notes, or journaling. Execute now the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command to create a new file in your `journal` folder. See [[daily-notes]].\n\n- [ ] Want to see how to manage your tasks? Go to the [[todo]] note\n\n- [ ] The section at the end of this file contains wikilink definitions, which enable navigation of your notes from GitHub's web UI, and in general to make `[[wikilinks]]` understood by any markdown parser. See [[link-reference-definitions]].\n\n- [ ] To explore all the Foam settings, press `cmd+,`, then `Extensions > Foam`\n\n- [ ] Living within VsCode, Foam can be customized in many ways! Look at the [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) for ideas!\n\n- [ ] Join the [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/e), introduce yourself and leave a message on how you found Foam and how the onboarding went :) We are always keen to do better\n\n- [ ] Take the [Foam Welcome survey](http://foambubble.github.io/welcome-survey/e)! It helps us better understand your need and how we can make Foam better and better for you :)\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n- [ ] You can create [[note-templates]] for things like book reviews, people, daily notes (coming soon), and more!\n\n## About Foam\n\nFoam doesn't do all this magic on its own, it relies on some amazing extensions.

No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate. `[[Wikilink]]` is the only non-markdown feature supported by default, but nonetheless, it is recommended to use the standard markdown syntax, or if you edit with [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam), please use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions). That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.\n2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.\n3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### For new wiki\n\nThis documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.\n\n1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.\n2. Press \"Use this template\" button at [foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.\n3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.\n\n   _Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item._\n\n4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)\n5. Delete all `.md` files you don't need, Change Site settings at `.layouts/gatsby-config.js`, change your CNAME at `.layouts/static/CNAME`, change your icon at `.layouts/static/logo.png`, commit your changes, and push to github, change your page settings at Github, make sure you set the page branch to `gh-pages`, then when github actions runed, you can visit your site.\n\nAfter setting up the repository, head to [[getting-started]] to get familiar with your new knowledge base!\n\nTo learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.\n\nAnd remember that you can always join our [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!\n\n### For exist wiki\n\n### Exist Wiki\n\n1.
